abstract: In recent years, commercial and research interest in service robots working
  in everyday environments has grown. These devices are expected to move autonomously
  in crowded environments, maximizing not only movement efficiency and safety parameters,
  but also social acceptability. Extending traditional path planning modules with
  socially aware criteria, while maintaining fast algorithms capable of reacting to
  human behavior without causing discomfort, can be a complex challenge. Solving this
  challenge has involved the development of proactive systems that take into account
  cooperation (and not only interaction) with the people around them, the determined
  incorporation of approaches based on Deep Learning, or the recent fusion with skills
  coming from the field of human–robot interaction (speech, touch). This review analyzes
  approaches to socially aware navigation and classifies them according to the strategies
  followed by the robot to manage interaction (or cooperation) with humans.
