 abstract = {This paper presents a combination of Active Learning (AL) and Transfer Learning (TL) for efficiently adapting Human Pose (HP) estimators to individual videos. The proposed approach quantifies estimation uncertainty through the temporal changes and unnaturalness of estimated HPs. These uncertainty criteria are combined with clustering-based representativeness criterion to avoid the useless selection of similar samples. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed method achieves high learning efficiency and outperforms comparative methods.},
