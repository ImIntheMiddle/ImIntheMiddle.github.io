abstract: This paper presents a combination of Active Learning (AL) and Transfer Learning
  (TL) for efficiently adapting Human Pose (HP) estimators to individual videos. The
  proposed approach quantifies estimation uncertainty through the temporal changes
  and unnaturalness of estimated HPs. These uncertainty criteria are combined with
  clustering-based representativeness criterion to avoid the useless selection of
  similar samples. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed method achieves high
  learning efficiency and outperforms comparative methods.
