abstract: 'Human Pose (HP) estimation is actively researched because of its wide range
  of applications. However, even estimators pre-trained on large datasets may not
  perform satisfactorily due to a domain gap between the training and test data. To
  address this issue, we present our approach combining Active Learning (AL) and Transfer
  Learning (TL) to adapt HP estimators to individual video domains efficiently. For
  efficient learning, our approach quantifies (i) the estimation uncertainty based
  on the temporal changes in the estimated heatmaps and (ii) the unnaturalness in
  the estimated full-body HPs. These quantified criteria are then effectively combined
  with the state-of-the-art representativeness criterion to select uncertain and diverse
  samples for efficient HP estimator learning. Furthermore, we reconsider the existing
  Active Transfer Learning (ATL) method to introduce novel ideas related to the retraining
  methods and Stopping Criteria (SC). Experimental results demonstrate that our method
  enhances learning efficiency and outperforms comparative methods. Our code is publicly
