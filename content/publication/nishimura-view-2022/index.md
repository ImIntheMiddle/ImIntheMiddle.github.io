abstract: We introduce view birdification, the problem of recovering ground-plane
  movements of people in a crowd from an ego-centric video captured from an observer
  (e.g., a person or a vehicle) also moving in the crowd. Recovered ground-plane movements
  would provide a sound basis for situational understanding and benefit downstream
  applications in computer vision and robotics. In this paper, we formulate view birdification
  as a geometric trajectory reconstruction problem and derive a cascaded optimization
  method from a Bayesian perspective. The method first estimates the observer's movement
  and then localizes surrounding pedestrians for each frame while taking into account
  the local interactions between them. We introduce three datasets by leveraging synthetic
  and real trajectories of people in crowds and evaluate the effectiveness of our
  method. The results demonstrate the accuracy of our method and set the ground for
  further studies of view birdification as an important but challenging visual understanding
  problem.
