 abstract = {We introduce view birdification, the problem of recovering ground-plane movements of people in a crowd from an ego-centric video captured from an observer (e.g., a person or a vehicle) also moving in the crowd. Recovered ground-plane movements would provide a sound basis for situational understanding and benefit downstream applications in computer vision and robotics. In this paper, we formulate view birdification as a geometric trajectory reconstruction problem and derive a cascaded optimization method from a Bayesian perspective. The method first estimates the observer's movement and then localizes surrounding pedestrians for each frame while taking into account the local interactions between them. We introduce three datasets by leveraging synthetic and real trajectories of people in crowds and evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The results demonstrate the accuracy of our method and set the ground for further studies of view birdification as an important but challenging visual understanding problem.},
