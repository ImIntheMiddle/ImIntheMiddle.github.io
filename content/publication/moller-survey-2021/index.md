abstract: Intelligent systems are increasingly part of our everyday lives and have
  been integrated seamlessly to the point where it is difficult to imagine a world
  without them. Physical manifestations of those systems on the other hand, in the
  form of embodied agents or robots, have so far been used only for specific applications
  and are often limited to functional roles (e.g. in the industry, entertainment and
  military fields). Given the current growth and innovation in the research communities
  concerned with the topics of robot navigation, human-robot-interaction and human
  activity recognition, it seems like this might soon change. Robots are increasingly
  easy to obtain and use and the acceptance of them in general is growing. However,
  the design of a socially compliant robot that can function as a companion needs
  to take various areas of research into account. This paper is concerned with the
  navigation aspect of a socially-compliant robot and provides a survey of existing
  solutions for the relevant areas of research as well as an outlook on possible future
  directions.
