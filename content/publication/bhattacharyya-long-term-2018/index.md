abstract: Progress towards advanced systems for assisted and autonomous driving is
  leveraging recent advances in recognition and segmentation methods. Yet, we are
  still facing challenges in bringing reliable driving to inner cities, as those are
  composed of highly dynamic scenes observed from a moving platform at considerable
  speeds. Anticipation becomes a key element in order to react timely and prevent
  accidents. In this paper we argue that it is necessary to predict at least 1 second
  and we thus propose a new model that jointly predicts ego motion and people trajectories
  over such large time horizons. We pay particular attention to modeling the uncertainty
  of our estimates arising from the non-deterministic nature of natural trafÔ¨Åc scenes.
  Our experimental results show that it is indeed possible to predict people trajectories
  at the desired time horizons and that our uncertainty estimates are informative
  of the prediction error. We also show that both sequence modeling of trajectories
  as well as our novel method of long term odometry prediction are essential for best
  performance.
