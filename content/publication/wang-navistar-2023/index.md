abstract: "Developing robotic technologies for use in human society requires ensuring
  the safety of robots' navigation behaviors while adhering to pedestrians' expectations
  and social norms. However, maintaining real-time communication between robots and
  pedestrians to avoid collisions can be challenging. To address these challenges,
  we propose a novel socially-aware navigation benchmark called NaviSTAR, which utilizes
  a hybrid Spatio-Temporal grAph tRansformer (STAR) to understand interactions in
  human-rich environments fusing potential crowd multi-modal information. We leverage
  off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm with preference learning to train a
  policy and a reward function network with supervisor guidance. Additionally, we
  design a social score function to evaluate the overall performance of social navigation.
  To compare, we train and test our algorithm and other state-of-the-art methods in
  both simulator and real-world scenarios independently. Our results show that NaviSTAR
  outperforms previous methods with outstanding performancefootnotepÌŒhantomThe source
