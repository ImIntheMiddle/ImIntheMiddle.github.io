 abstract = {Developing robotic technologies for use in human society requires ensuring the safety of robots' navigation behaviors while adhering to pedestrians' expectations and social norms. However, maintaining real-time communication between robots and pedestrians to avoid collisions can be challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel socially-aware navigation benchmark called NaviSTAR, which utilizes a hybrid Spatio-Temporal grAph tRansformer (STAR) to understand interactions in human-rich environments fusing potential crowd multi-modal information. We leverage off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm with preference learning to train a policy and a reward function network with supervisor guidance. Additionally, we design a social score function to evaluate the overall performance of social navigation. To compare, we train and test our algorithm and other state-of-the-art methods in both simulator and real-world scenarios independently. Our results show that NaviSTAR outperforms previous methods with outstanding performance\footnote\p̌hantom\The source code and experiment videos of this work are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/san-navistar},
