abstract: Deciphering human behaviors to predict their future paths/trajectories and
  what they would do from videos is important in many applications. Motivated by this
  idea, this paper studies predicting a pedestrian's future path jointly with future
  activities. We propose an end-to-end, multi-task learning system utilizing rich
  visual features about human behavioral information and interaction with their surroundings.
  To facilitate the training, the network is learned with an auxiliary task of predicting
  future location in which the activity will happen. Experimental results demonstrate
  our state-of-the-art performance over two public benchmarks on future trajectory
  prediction. Moreover, our method is able to produce meaningful future activity prediction
  in addition to the path. The result provides the first empirical evidence that joint
  modeling of paths and activities benefits future path prediction.
