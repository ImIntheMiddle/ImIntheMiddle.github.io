abstract: 'Human trajectory forecasting is an inherently multi-modal problem. Uncertainty
  in future trajectories stems from two sources: (a) sources that are known to the
  agent but unknown to the model, such as long term goals and (b)sources that are
  unknown to both the agent & the model, such as intent of other agents & irreducible
  randomness indecisions. We propose to factorize this uncertainty into its epistemic
  & aleatoric sources. We model the epistemic un-certainty through multimodality in
  long term goals and the aleatoric uncertainty through multimodality in waypoints&
  paths. To exemplify this dichotomy, we also propose a novel long term trajectory
  forecasting setting, with prediction horizons upto a minute, an order of magnitude
  longer than prior works. Finally, we presentY-net, a scene com-pliant trajectory
  forecasting network that exploits the pro-posed epistemic & aleatoric structure
  for diverse trajectory predictions across long prediction horizons.Y-net significantly
  improves previous state-of-the-art performance on both (a) The well studied short
  prediction horizon settings on the Stanford Drone & ETH/UCY datasets and (b) The
  proposed long prediction horizon setting on the re-purposed Stanford Drone & Intersection
  Drone datasets.'
