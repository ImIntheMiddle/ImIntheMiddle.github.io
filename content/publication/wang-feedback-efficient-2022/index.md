abstract: 'Socially aware robot navigation, where a robot is required to optimize
  its trajectory to maintain comfortable and compliant spatial interactions with humans
  in addition to reaching its goal without collisions, is a fundamental yet challenging
  task in the context of human-robot interaction. While existing learning-based methods
  have achieved better performance than the preceding model-based ones, they still
  have drawbacks: reinforcement learning depends on the handcrafted reward that is
  unlikely to effectively quantify broad social compliance, and can lead to reward
  exploitation problems; meanwhile, inverse reinforcement learning suffers from the
  need for expensive human demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a feedback-efficient
  active preference learning approach, FAPL, that distills human comfort and expectation
  into a reward model to guide the robot agent to explore latent aspects of social
  compliance. We further introduce hybrid experience learning to improve the efficiency
  of human feedback and samples, and evaluate benefits of robot behaviors learned
  from FAPL through extensive simulation experiments and a user study (N=10) employing
  a physical robot to navigate with human subjects in real-world scenarios. Source
