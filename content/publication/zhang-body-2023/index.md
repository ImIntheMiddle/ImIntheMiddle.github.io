abstract: While 3D body reconstruction methods have made remarkable progress recently,
  it remains difficult to acquire the sufficiently accurate and numerous 3D supervisions
  required for training. In this paper, we propose textbfKNOWN, a framework that effectively
  utilizes body textbfKNOWledge and utextbfNÈ©rtainty modeling to compensate for insufficient
  3D supervisions. KNOWN exploits a comprehensive set of generic body constraints
  derived from well-established body knowledge. These generic constraints precisely
  and explicitly characterize the reconstruction plausibility and enable 3D reconstruction
  models to be trained without any 3D data. Moreover, existing methods typically use
  images from multiple datasets during training, which can result in data noise (textite.g.,
  inconsistent joint annotation) and data imbalance (textite.g., minority images representing
  unusual poses or captured from challenging camera views). KNOWN solves these problems
  through a novel probabilistic framework that models both aleatoric and epistemic
  uncertainty. Aleatoric uncertainty is encoded in a robust Negative Log-Likelihood
  (NLL) training loss, while epistemic uncertainty is used to guide model refinement.
  Experiments demonstrate that KNOWN's body reconstruction outperforms prior weakly-supervised
  approaches, particularly on the challenging minority images.
