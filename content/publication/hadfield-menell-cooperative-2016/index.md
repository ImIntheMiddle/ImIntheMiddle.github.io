abstract: For an autonomous system to be helpful to humans and to pose no unwarranted
  risks, it needs to align its values with those of the humans in its environment
  in such a way that its actions contribute to the maximization of value for the humans.
  We propose a formal definition of the value alignment problem as cooperative inverse
  reinforcement learning (CIRL). A CIRL problem is a cooperative, partial-information
  game with two agents, human and robot; both are rewarded according to the human's
  reward function, but the robot does not initially know what this is. In contrast
  to classical IRL, where the human is assumed to act optimally in isolation, optimal
  CIRL solutions produce behaviors such as active teaching, active learning, and communicative
  actions that are more effective in achieving value alignment. We show that computing
  optimal joint policies in CIRL games can be reduced to solving a POMDP, prove that
  optimality in isolation is suboptimal in CIRL, and derive an approximate CIRL algorithm.
